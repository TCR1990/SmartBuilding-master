# SmartBuilding
This repository is for accessing the API for the Connected Places Catapult 'Smart Building', acquiring data, and plotting.

'scraper.py' is a module which can be used to login and access the API, and to retreive data for storage in variables. It also includes functions for plotting data.

'scraperplot.py' is a script which allows for data to be plotted through interaction with the console.

See 'scraper_notebook.ipynb' for a demonstration of how these can be used.
